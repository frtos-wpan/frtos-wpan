atben on STM32-E407 (Contiki) design verification
=================================================

This set of experiments examines the SPI interface.


nSEL vs. SCLK timing: register read
-----------------------------------

Software state: frtos-wpan/freertos commit

Two timing parameters are important here:

- t5 (12.4.7) LSB last to MSB next byte: 250 ns
  Where the next byte is being received.
- t9 (12.4.12) last SCLK rise to nSEL high: 250 ns

This is a register read, i.e., one byte is sent and then one is
received:

t5 is met with 2.3 us > 250 ns.
t9 is also met with 840 ns > 250 ns.


nSEL vs. SCLK timing: register write
------------------------------------

Software state: frtos-wpan/freertos commit
dc3e71e7d268aae8d79f8f7005026888f11a8fc2

When writing to a register, we're only concerned with t9.
This is the timing:

t9 is met with 320 ns > 250 ns.


nSEL vs. SCLK timing: buffer read
---------------------------------

Software state: frtos-wpan/freertos commit
dc3e71e7d268aae8d79f8f7005026888f11a8fc2

A buffer read is similar to a register read in that t5 and t9
have to be observed. This is a read of four data bytes, which
means that a total of seven bytes is send over SPI:

- the buffer read command,
- the length byte,
- the four data bytes, and
- the LQI byte.

t5 is met with 2.1 us > 250 ns.
t9 is met with 800 ns > 250 ns.
