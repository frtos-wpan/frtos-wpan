To do items and known issues
============================

In no particular order and not necessarily complete.


General
-------

- check out fresh repos and build from scratch (and move old things to a new
  name), to verify that the repos are complete

- configure 6LoWPAN/RPL network

- set up JTAG, in case debugging is needed


FreeRTOS, general
-----------------

- rename E407 ... maybe STM32_E407_GCC ?

- clean up and submit E407 support to FreeRTOS mainline

- populate hooks (some marked with @@@)


Contiki, general
----------------

- submit verbosity control to Contiki mainline

- submit SLP_TR after frame write fix (rf230bb.c) to Contiki mainline


Hybrid
------

- support Contiki rtimers in hybrid

- separate hybrid from E407 port (maybe just fork)

- define how interrupts are passed to Contiki under FreeRTOS. Possible
  solution:
  - run them from a high-priority interrupt task,
  - run Contiki interrupt handler directly from FreeRTOS interrupt handler
  Note that the hardware would always be configured from the FreeRTOS
  side (i.e., by the "Demo")

  Tentative solution: keep it simple and pass them directly.

- we fail portASSERT_IF_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY_INVALID in
  FreeRTOS/Source/tasks.c:xTaskGetTickCountFromISR

  Work-around for now: disable the check.
  
- move frame retrieval out of interrupt handler; downgrade critical
  section handling to less drastic mechanism than currently used

- consider using more WPAN-specific names for WPAN settings than, say,
  RF_CHANNEL


atben experiments
-----------------

- fix issues marked with @@@ in platform/stm32-e407/hal.c
  and/or Demo/E407/hal.c
