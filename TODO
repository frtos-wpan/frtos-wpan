To do items and known issues
============================

In no particular order and not necessarily complete.


General
-------

- check out fresh repos and build from scratch (and move old things to a new
  name), to verify that the repos are complete

- configure 6LoWPAN/RPL network

- set up JTAG, in case debugging is needed


FreeRTOS, general
-----------------

- rename E407 ... maybe STM32_E407_GCC ?

- clean up and submit E407 support to FreeRTOS mainline

- populate hooks (some marked with @@@)


Contiki, general
----------------

- submit verbosity control to Contiki mainline

  Submitted for consideration to mailing list.

- submit SLP_TR after frame write fix (rf230bb.c) to Contiki mainline

  Created pull request. Resolved as feature, not bug.
  https://github.com/contiki-os/contiki/pull/295

  Submitted extended comment instead.

Hybrid
------

- support Contiki rtimers in hybrid

- separate hybrid from E407 port (maybe just fork)

- remove overly platform-specific or application-specific items (such
  as transceiver setup, shell initialization, etc.) from Contiki side
  of hybrid (keeping them somewhere in Contiki, though)

- define how interrupts are passed to Contiki under FreeRTOS. Possible
  solution:
  - run them from a high-priority interrupt task,
  - run Contiki interrupt handler directly from FreeRTOS interrupt handler
  Note that the hardware would always be configured from the FreeRTOS
  side (i.e., by the "Demo")

  Tentative solution: keep it simple and pass them directly.

- we fail portASSERT_IF_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY_INVALID in
  FreeRTOS/Source/tasks.c:xTaskGetTickCountFromISR

  Work-around for now: disable the check.
  
- move frame retrieval out of interrupt handler; downgrade critical
  section handling to less drastic mechanism than currently used

- consider using more WPAN-specific names for WPAN settings than, say,
  RF_CHANNEL

- find a nicer way than hard-coding to set things like the EUI64, the
  PAN number, and the channel. Perhaps we can use the STM32Fxxx's U_ID
  for the long address, hard-code the rest, and allow changing PAN and
  channel from the shell. (The rest of Contiki cares only about the
  long address.)

- remove/disable the printfs in the rf230 driver to get quicker
  turn-around times. Then test if things still work.


atben experiments
-----------------

- fix issues marked with @@@ in platform/stm32-e407/hal.c
  and/or Demo/E407/hal.c


Linux
-----

- RFC6282 header compression is badly broken in Linux. A partial fix
  is in patches/linux-compression-partial-fix.patch
  Find out what happened there, complete patch, and submit upstream.

  Additional fix: wpwrak/ben-wpan-linux commit
  4b634d5591104354b15cbc6503cddde33961b4db

- simpleRPL has a few pending fixes, see doc/rpl.txt
