SCLK timing
-----------

The data sheet specifies only the maximum SCLK frequency (11.4.2 =
7.5 MHz) but not the duty cycle or minimum SCLK high or low times.

We therefore assume that a period must not be below 1/fSCLK and
that neither high or low must be shorter than 1/(2*fSCLK).

This measurement was taken with the system clock set to 48 MHz:

The period easily meets the constraints with 458 ns > 133 ns
The high time also meets the constraints with 82 ns > 67 ns
