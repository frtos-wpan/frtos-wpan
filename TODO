To do items and known issues
============================

In no particular order and not necessarily complete.


General
-------

- check out fresh repos and build from scratch (and move old things to a new
  name), to verify that the repos are complete

- configure 6LoWPAN/RPL network

- set up JTAG, in case debugging is needed


FreeRTOS, general
-----------------

- rename E407 ... maybe STM32_E407_GCC ?

- clean up and submit E407 support to FreeRTOS mainline

- populate hooks (some marked with @@@)

- use configUSE_NEWLIB_REENTRANT (see commit
  cbcddc596b6facd3fa3bff085dc78f7df24310d2)
  Requires either private copy of FreeRTOSConfig.h or change of
  copying/patching script. Also, where does _REENT_INIT_PTR come
  from ?


Contiki, general
----------------

- submit verbosity control to Contiki mainline


Hybrid
------

- return correct value in clocks.c (clock_seconds)

- support Contiki rtimers in hybrid

- separate hybrid from E407 port (maybe just fork)

- define how interrupts are passed to Contiki under FreeRTOS. Possible
  solution:
  - run them from a high-priority interrupt task,
  - run Contiki interrupt handler directly from FreeRTOS interrupt handler
  Note that the hardware would always be configured from the FreeRTOS
  side (i.e., by the "Demo")

  Tentative solution: keep it simple and pass them directly.


atben experiments
-----------------

- make SPI-to-atben adapter and use hardware SPI device
  (e.g., SPI2 available on UEXT)

- fix issues marked with @@@ in platform/stm32-e407/hal.c
  and/or Demo/E407/hal.c
