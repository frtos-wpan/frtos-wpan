atben on STM32-E407 (Contiki) design verification
=================================================

This set of experiments examines the SPI interface.


nSEL vs. SCLK timing
--------------------

Software state: frtos-wpan/freertos commit
b5076098e1ae72ccd5ab3657a28fa05b3cc71c2f

Two timing parameters are important here:

- t5 (12.4.7) LSB last to MSB next byte: 250 ns
  Where the next byte is being received.
- t9 (12.4.12) last SCLK rise to nSEL high: 250 ns

This is a register read, i.e., one byte is sent and then one is
received:

t5 is met with 1.1 us > 250 ns.
t9 is also met with 700 ns > 250 ns.
