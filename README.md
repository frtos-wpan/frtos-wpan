The frtos-wpan project aims to bring WPAN (IEEE 802.15.4) functionality
to FreeRTOS by running the Contiki OS with its IPv6 and WPAN stack as a
FreeRTOS task.

While the bulk of this work should be platform-independent (i.e., the
addition of a "FreeRTOS" platform to Contiki), any platform-specific
parts are for Cortex M3 or M4 MCUs of the STM32 family.

Unless stated otherwise, all code in this project is developed by
Werner Almesberger for Actility S.A., and licensed under LGPLv2 by
Actility S.A.
