Use of 6LoWPAN
==============

This describes an experimental setup of one or two Linux nodes and one
FreeRTOS-Contiki node. We simply exchange pings, which also involves a
neighbor solicitation/advertisement exchange.


Contiki setup
-------------

Software:

frtos-wpan/freertos commit 6978b8ea65328837ed9966bd76907659a16b9ca9
frtos-wpan/contiki-outoftree commit 781fa0156528b866ff4c3640b50849241d0bf8ea
frtos/wpan/contiki commit 1fb1d2a4d826396109d471b447280ea7120db306

Hardware:

Development board:	Olimed STM32-E407
Adapter board:		ODEV
802.15.4 radio:		atben

Alternatively, the atben can be placed in the board's uSD slot, in
which case ODEV is not needed. The FreeRTOS-Contiki hybrid then has
to be built with the following two options commented out in
FreeRTOS/Demo/E407/Makefile:

#CFLAGS += -DODEV
#HAL = hal-spi


Linux setup
-----------

Software:

A kernel tree with some drivers and fixes that are not yet in mainline:
wpwrak/ben-wpan-linux commit 4b634d5591104354b15cbc6503cddde33961b4db

The linux-zigbee user-space utilities, see
http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/linux-zigbee/wiki/BuildingUserspaceTools

Packages (if using Ubuntu or similar): iproute, iputils-ping

Hardware:

Host:		regular Linux PC
802.15.4 radio:	atusb


Network configuration
---------------------

IEEE 802.15.4 Channel:	11 (2405 MHz)
PAN ID:			0xabcd
16-bit short addresses:	0x8000 + node
64-bit long addresses:	a0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0 + node
IPv6 link-local addr.:	fe80::a200:0:0:0 + node

Where the nodes are 1 (Linux PC), 2 (second Linux PC), and 3 (hybrid).
For example, IEEE 802.15.4 addresses of the first Linux PC are thus
0x8001 and a0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1, and its IPv6 address is
fe80::a200:0:0:1


Contiki configuration
---------------------

The network configuration of the Contiki node is hard-coded to the
settings in FreeRTOS/Demo/E407/Makefile


Linux configuration
-------------------

For the first Linux node:

# iz add wpan-phy0
# ip link set wpan0 address a0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1	# see below
# ifconfig wpan0 up
# iz set wpan0 abcd 8001 11
# ip link add link wpan0 name lowpan0 type lowpan
# ip link set lowpan0 address a0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
# ip link set lowpan0 up

For the second Linux node:

# iz add wpan-phy0
# ip link set wpan0 address a0:0:0:0:0:0:0:2	# see below
# ifconfig wpan0 up
# iz set wpan0 abcd 8002 11
# ip link add link wpan0 name lowpan0 type lowpan
# ip link set lowpan0 address a0:0:0:0:0:0:0:2
# ip link set lowpan0 up

It's currently not necessary to set the address of the wpan0 interface,
but not doing so causes incoming packets to be misclassified in the
kernel, which may cause trouble in the future.


Ping from Linux to Hybrid
-------------------------

% ping6 fe80::a200:0:0:1%lowpan0

The %lowpan0 selects the 6LoWPAN interface and it equivalent to

% ping6 -I lowpan0 fe80::a200:0:0:1


Ping from Hybrid to Linux
-------------------------

Ping to the first Linux node:

Contiki> ping fe80::a200:0:0:1

Ping to the second Linux node:

Contiki> ping fe80::a200:0:0:2

Note that Contiki receives the response but does nothing with it.
There is no feedback on the serial console to indicate whether the
ping succeeded or not.
