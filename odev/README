odev - atben adapter board for Olimex STM32-E407 
================================================

The main function of this board is to connect an 8:10 card holder to
the signals available on the Olimex STM32-E407 development board. The
pin assignment is chosen such that the SPI interface can drive an
atben board inserted into the 8:10 card interface.

The board also routes the TX and RX lines of UART6 from UEXT to a
100 mil header, such that a serial console can be used even when odev
is present.

It can also be equipped with an ATtiny87 microcontroller. If present,
this microcontroller as access to the the TX/RX lines, a FET to switch
atben power, and via an additional header also to the reset and B0
signals of the development board.

This can be used by writing firmware that, for example:

- resets with B0 set to run code from Flash when the button if pressed
  once,

- resets with B0 set to run DFU when the button is pressed another
  time,

- power-cycles the atben board if the button is pressed and held down
  for a certain amount of time.

If the USB receptacle is equipped as well, then V-USB firmware could
be loaded that implements remote reset and that gives access to the
serial console, thereby eliminating the need for an external serial
interface.
